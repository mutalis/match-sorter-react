  "description": "This example is using React and various other dependencies you can find listed in the dependencies. match-sorter doesn't have any dependencies and is actually quite small. Here we're using downshift to demonstrate a common use case for match-sorter.\n\nThe main thing to notice here is how well Match Sorter filters/sorts the available options. The default filters fine, but doesn't really sort things in a way that makes a whole lot of sense. Fuse.js filters fine too, but also the sorting doesn't make a lot of intuitive sense either and the order of things changes quite a bit while you're typing.",
